title: The Once And Future Stack
---

The current iteration of the "sMAP stack" has changed since the original conception:

* Timeseries Database: [Berkeley Tree Database (BtrDB)](https://github.com/SoftwareDefinedBuildings/quasar)
* Metadata Database: [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/)
* Archiver: [Giles](https://github.com/gtfierro/giles)
* Plotter: [uPMU Plotter](https://github.com/SoftwareDefinedBuildings/upmu-plotter)
* Status Dashboard: [Deckard](https://github.com/gtfierro/deckard)

Though the installation/setup instructions for all of these exist in some form across many links, this page
will bring them all together for a **single definitive installation document** for The Once And Future Stack.

This installation assumes a Debian-based distro such as Ubuntu. These instructions have been developed and tested
on Ubuntu 14.04, 14.10.x and 15.04, but installing these packages on other systems should be straightforward.

These are the required packages on the system for the rest of the instructions to work.

### Apt Packages

If you do not have `apt-get` on your system, you can try [`brew`](http://brew.sh/) for Mac OS X or `yum` for RPM systems.
If you are on Windoze, you are on your own.

* git
* librados-dev
* mongodb
* npm
* nodejs
* nodejs-legacy
* supervisor
* mercurial
* curl
* python-dev
* python-pip
* build-essential

`sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip build-essential librados-dev git mongodb nodejs nodejs-legacy npm supervisor mercurial curl`


### Others

#### Go

There are several Go-based components. Occasional binary releases are available
for these, but it is recommended to compile them from source while still under
active development. It is recommended to follow the [official installation
instructions](https://golang.org/dl/), including setting up your `$GOROOT` environment variable.

I prefer to place all environment variables in my `~/.bashrc` file.

Make sure that your `$GOPATH` environment variable is configured correctly and
is on your `$PATH`. Also, add `$GOPATH/bin` to the end of your `$PATH` as well.

This is how I do it:

```
$ mkdir $HOME/go
# inside .bashrc
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```

#### NodeJS

Once `nodejs` and `npm` are installed, you will need to install both
[bower](http://bower.io/) and
[react-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tools) in a special way so
that they are generally accessible on your system. The other node packages can
be installed "locally".

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g bower react-tools
```

#### Meteor

`curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh`


## <a name="MongoDB"></a>MongoDB

Mongo will have been installed by the above aptitude command. For deployments, it is recommended to use the
Mongo service handler, which will handle everything for you:

```bash
$ sudo service mongodb start
```

For development, it can be helpful to run MongoDB in the foreground:

```bash
$ mkdir mongodb_data
$ mongod --dbpath mongodb_data
```

Be aware that if this crashes, you will need to manually restart.

## <a name="BtrDB"></a>BtrDB

```bash
$ go get -u -a github.com/SoftwareDefinedBuildings/quasar/qserver
$ go install -a github.com/SoftwareDefinedBuildings/quasar/qserver
$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SoftwareDefinedBuildings/quasar/master/quasar.conf
$ qserver -makedb
```

```ini
# /etc/supervisor/conf.d/quasar.conf
[program:quasar]
command=/home/gabe/go/bin/qserver
autostart=true
autorestart=true
stderr_logfile=/var/log/quasar.err.log
stdout_logfile=/var/log/quasar.out.log
```


## <a name="Giles"></a>Giles

```bash
$ go get -u -a github.com/gtfierro/giles
$ go install -a github.com/gtfierro/giles
$ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gtfierro/giles/master/giles.cfg
```

```ini
# /etc/supervisor/conf.d/giles.conf
[program:giles]
command=/home/gabe/go/bin/giles
autostart=true
autorestart=true
stderr_logfile=/var/log/giles.err.log
stdout_logfile=/var/log/giles.out.log
```

## <A Name="Plotter"></a>uPMU Plotter

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/SoftwareDefinedBuildings/upmu-plotter.git
```

Edit `upmuplot/settings.json` and `upmuplot/client/home.js`. The addresses can be hostnames
or IP addresses. All ports below are default, but if you have changed them in your installation,
change them here.

* `upmuplot/settings.json`

  ```json
  {
      "archiverUrl": "http://<address of btrdb>:9000",
      "public": { "archiverUrl": "http://<address of btrdb>:9000" }
  }
  ```

* `upmuplot/client/home.js`

  ```javascript
  tagsURL: 'http://<address of giles>:8079/api/query',
  dataURLStart: 'http://<address of btrdb>:9000/data/uuid/',
  bracketURL: 'http://<address of btrdb>:9000/q/bracket',
  csvURL: 'http://<address of btrdb>:9000/wrappedcsv',
  ```

* Supervisord conf file

  ```ini
  # /etc/supervisor/conf.d/plotter.conf
  [program:plotter]
  command=/usr/local/bin/meteor --settings settings.json
  directory=/srv/plotter/upmuplot
  autostart=true
  autorestart=true
  stderr_logfile=/var/log/plotter.err.log
  stdout_logfile=/var/log/plotter.out.log
  ```

## <a name="Deckard"></a>Deckard

```bash
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ jsx react_src public/build
```

```ini
# /etc/supervisor/conf.d/deckard.conf
[program:deckard]
command=/usr/bin/npm start
directory=/srv/deckard
autostart=true
autorestart=true
stderr_logfile=/var/log/deckard.err.log
stdout_logfile=/var/log/deckard.out.log
```
