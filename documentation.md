This site is a placeholder for the next generation of sMAP documentation, starting with Giles and moving towards the
recent changes in sMAP.

### Old Documentation

The original, helpful, and somewhat outdated sMAP documentation can be found at
[http://pythonhosted.org/Smap/en/2.0/](http://pythonhosted.org/Smap/en/2.0/). Much of this
documentation will be borrowed from that site, though here there will be much updated information
including completely new sections on the Giles archiver and sMAP actuator

### Giles Documentation

The GoDoc for the Giles codebase can be found at
[https://godoc.org/github.com/gtfierro/giles](https://godoc.org/github.com/gtfierro/giles).
This is useful for developers or those interested in how Giles is put together.

### Archiver Interface
